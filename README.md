# Introduction

For one of my private projects, I needed a clearable input field component in Ionic (like jquery mobile one). I searched a lot and found some plain Angular clearable input field, but these had too much other dependencies and mostly didn't look that good within Ionic. Then . So I spent some time to create my one.

# Features

The ionic-input-clearable component has the following features:
- add clear button on the right side of the input field

# Ionic compatibility

Tested on Ionic version 1.3.1

# Installation

1. Import the `ionic-input-clearable` javascript and css file into your HTML file:

  ```html
  <script src="sw2.ionic.input-clearable.js"></script>
  <link href="sw2.ionic.input-clearable.css" rel="stylesheet">
  ```

2. Add `sw2.ionic.input-clearable` as a dependency on your Ionic app:

  ```javascript
  angular.module('myApp', [
    'ionic',
    'sw2.ionic.input-clearable'
  ]);
  ```

# Usage

To use the `ionic-input-clearable` directive you need set add `ionic-input-clearable` attribute to input field:
```html
<input ng-model="searchkey" type="text" ionic-input-clearable />
```

REMARK: In order to let the clear button is clickable, please use "div" instead of "label" to wrap your input field.

# Options

Add attribute:

"data-hideClearBtnOnBlur": hide the clear button when INPUT is blur

"data-input-clear-btn-class": change clear button class (default: ion-close)

```html
<input ng-model="searchkey" type="text" ionic-input-clearable data-hideClearBtnOnBlur data-input-clear-btn-class="ion-close-circled" />
```
